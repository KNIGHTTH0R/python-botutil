botutil
=======

Small libraries for Python botmakers. Supports Python 3 and 2.7.

The [twitter][pypi-twitter] package is required. Install it with:

```shell
pip3 install twitter  # for Python 3
# or
pip install twitter   # for Python 2
```

Some unit tests are provided to test the libraries with both Python 3 and
Python 2.7. Run these with:

```shell
make test
# or
make test_python3
make test_python2
```


Twitter
-------

### botutil.post_tweet()

Tweet a string and receive the Twitter response.

```python
tweet = botutil.post_tweet('beep boop')
```

It reads Twitter credentials from environment variables. This allows you to
keep API tokens out of the code. For example, you might run the following in
the shell before running a bot script:

```shell
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="appkey"
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="appsecret"
export TWITTER_USER_TOKEN="123456789-mytoken"
export TWITTER_USER_SECRET="mysecret"
```


File access
-----------

### botutil.BigList

This class provides fast random access to lines of text in a file.

```python
blist = BigList('lines.txt')

total_lines = len(blist)
millionth_line = blist[999999]
last_line = blist[-1]
random_line = blist.choice()
```

It's useful for dealing with a large number of small lines â€“ for example,
[@everywikt][everywikt] reads from a list of over 4&nbsp;million words, one
per line.

### botutil.DB

A wrapper class for working with SQLite databases.

```python
db = DB('corpus.sqlite3')
c = db.cursor()

c.execute('BEGIN')
c.execute('UPDATE Word SET tweeted = ? WHERE id = ?', (1, 123))
c.execute('COMMIT')
```

It's intended for working with explicit transactions, as shown above, so
autocommit is disabled by default.
